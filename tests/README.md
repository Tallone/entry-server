### Why doesn't Axum have a good documentation generation tool? 
I wish there was a command like `cargo doc` that could generate documentation non-invasively without code, but I haven't found a similar tool yet. So I'm manually maintaining all the APIs through ApiDog (thanks for the free plan), which can be viewed online through this [link](https://entry-server.apidog.io/).
